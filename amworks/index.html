                <a href="">AMWorks, LLC's</a> primary focus is on developing cutting-edge antimatter technologies for propulsion, energy generation, and medical applications. It was co-founded by two highly decorated scientists, Alexander Magoun and Henry Hanniford in 1944, both of which are highly passionate in the field of antimatter physics.
                AMWorks is a mission-driven company that aims to revolutionize the way humanity harnesses and utilizes antimatter to "achieve a higher understanding of the universe."
                <br><br>
                Over the decades, AMWorks has made significant contributions to antimatter research, including the development of antimatter containment systems, antimatter propulsion technologies for spacecraft, and advancements in medical imaging and cancer treatment using antimatter particles. However, none exceed in technical prowess as their flagship research facility, Sigma Research Subterranean Complex (SRC), located deep beneath the seabed off the coast of Azkaland.
                <br><br>
                Today, AMWorks stands as one of the biggest players in the tech/antimatter industry, and the biggest privately-owned antimatter research company in the world.
