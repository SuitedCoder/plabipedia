    <p>
        <a href="">AMWorks, LLC</a> is an EHF multinational technology company that performs advanced antimatter research and development.
        Co-founded in 1978 by Alexander Magoun and Henry Hanniford, the company has been at the forefront of antimatter propulsion systems, energy generation, and applications in various fields including aerospace, medicine, and defense.
        It was restructured as a subsidiary of <a href="../sigma_rd">Sigma Research and Development Group</a> in 1988.

            <p>
                Dr. Alexander Magoun and Henry Hanniford initiated research into antimatter technologies in the early 1970s as partners, driven by the potential of antimatter as a high-energy-density fuel source.
                Both scientists had backgrounds in particle physics and aerospace engineering, which fueled their ambition to harness antimatter for practical applications and brought them immense technical skills to pursue their goals.
                Within a few years of collaborative research and experimentation, they made significant breakthroughs in antimatter containment and propulsion technologies.
                <br><br>
                As assets, scope and size grew outside of what a traditional partnership could manage, they formally established AMWorks, LLC in the state of Azkaland, focusing on small-scale antimatter containment and propulsion experiments.
                <br><br>
                AMWorks began to pour capital into antimatter research, quickly growing from a small laboratory with just a handful of employees to a leading player in the antimatter research field by the mid-1980s.
                The company demonstrated numerous patents and publications to its name, attracting attention from government agencies and private investors interested in the potential of antimatter technology.
                <br><br>
                By 1988, AMWorks had expanded in scope and size to the point where Magoun and Hanniford recognized the need for a more structured corporate governance framework to manage the company's various subsidiaries and research initiatives.
                On March 15, 1988, they established Sigma Research and Development Group as the holding company of AMWorks.
                This restructuring allowed AMWorks to focus on its core research activities while Sigma RDG handled broader corporate functions.

            <p>
                AMWorks specializes in the development of advanced antimatter technologies, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Antimatter Containment Systems</li>
                    <li>Antimatter Propulsion Technologies</li>
                    <li>Energy Generation from Antimatter Reactions</li>
                    <li>Applications in Aerospace, Medicine, and Defense</li>
                </ul>
                AMWorks, LLC continuously pushes the boundaries of antimatter research, striving to unlock new possibilities and applications for this powerful energy source.
                It operates multiple research facilities worldwide, collaborating with academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry partners to advance the field of antimatter technology.
                However, none exceed in scale and scope than the Sigma Research Subterranean Complex (SRSC) located beneath the seabed off the coast of Azkaland, which serves as the primary research and development hub for AMWorks' biggest antimatter projects.
                <br><br>
                With construction efforts undertaken since late 1990s, the SRSC was officially commissioned in 2005 and has since been the site of numerous breakthroughs in antimatter containment, propulsion, and energy generation technologies. The site continues to be the biggest investment and focus of AMWorks, LLC's research efforts.
                <br><br>
                SRSC houses AMWorks, LLC's flagship technologies, including the Antimatter Annihilation Reactor (AAR) and the Antimatter Propulsion Drive (APD), which have revolutionized antimatter research and applications.
