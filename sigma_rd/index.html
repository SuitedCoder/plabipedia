                <h2>Origins as AMWorks, LLC</h2>
                <a href="../amworks">AMWorks, LLC</a> was founded in 1978 by Dr. Alexander Magoun and Henry Hanniford, who were both passionate about antimatter research and its potential applications. 
                The company was incorporated in the state of Azkaland and initially focused on small-scale antimatter containment and propulsion experiments. Soon, the company began to attract attention from government agencies and private investors interested in the potential of antimatter technology.
                Despite the large return offered by these investors, Magoun and Hanniford remained committed to keeping AMWorks privately-owned to maintain control over the company's research direction.
                <br><br>
                AMWORKS originally started as a small laboratory with just a handful of employees, but over the years, it grew rapidly as breakthroughs in antimatter containment and propulsion technologies were achieved.
                By the mid-1980s, AMWorks had established itself as a leading player in the antimatter research field, with numerous patents and publications to its name.
                <h2>Formation of Sigma RDG</h2>
                As AMWorks expanded in scope and size, Magoun and Hanniford recognized the need for a more structured corporate governance framework to manage the company's various subsidiaries and research initiatives.
                On March 15, 1988, they established Sigma Research and Development Group as the parent company of AMWorks.
                Sigma RDG was designed to provide strategic oversight, capital allocation, and governance for AMWorks and any future subsidiaries that might be created.
                This restructuring allowed AMWorks to focus on its core research activities while Sigma RDG handled broader corporate functions.

        <summary>2. Corporate Structure</summary>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Sigma RDG operates as a holding company with a board-based stewardship structure. The board of directors is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction of the company, approving major investments, and overseeing the performance of its subsidiaries.
                Board members are selected based on their contributions to science and technology, with a meritocratic system in place to ensure that the most qualified individuals are chosen.
                <br><br>
                AMWorks, as the primary subsidiary of Sigma RDG, handles day-to-day operations, research activities, and public relations. It is responsible for executing the research agenda set forth by Sigma RDG and managing relationships with government agencies, private investors, and other stakeholders.
                <br><br>
                This corporate structure was proposed by Hanniford to ensure that Sigma RDG and its subsidiaries can focus on the long-term mission despite low, diminishing, or outright deficit returns in the short term.
